# Demand-Forecasting-with-LSTM
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a supply chain demand forecasting project using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The project aims to improve the accuracy of demand forecasts, contributing to efficient inventory management and decision-making in supply chain operations.

# Motivation
Supply chain management relies heavily on accurate demand forecasting to optimize inventory levels, streamline production planning, foster collaboration chains, and enhance customer satisfaction and our focus was to improve forecasting accuracy using machine learning, particularly LSTM models.

# Key-Features
LSTM Model Implementation: The project employs LSTM neural networks for accurate demand forecasting.
Data Preprocessing: Rigorous preprocessing techniques, including outlier handling, missing value imputation, and feature elimination to ensure data quality.
Model Evaluation: Quantitative assessment using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and visual analysis via graphs.
Continuous Improvement: Emphasis on an iterative refinement approach based on feedback and insights from previous iterations.
